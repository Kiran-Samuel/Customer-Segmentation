# Customer-Segmentation

# Description

- The project deals with mall customer segmentation to find groups of customer with similar spending behaviour and income using K-means clustering.
- Deployed the clustering model as an API using FastAPI. 
- It was found that 5 clusters was the best number of clusters based on Elbow method and Silhouette score method.

# Code

- The entire code can be be tested using the **Project3 Code.ipynb** file 

# For customer segmenation

- Make sure to download the two pickled file: **scaling_kmeans.pkl** and **model_kmeans.pkl** and then run **group_app.ipynb** and proceed to the API for prediction

# Deployment files

- scaling_kmeans.pkl
- model_kmeans.pkl
- group_app.ipynb
